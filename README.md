# coffee-spies 


Introduction 
Thank you so much for your help in participating in the usability test for “Coffee Spies”! 

The goal for our trial testing in this initial stage of testing is to identify the main usability issues using a high fidelity prototype of the application; in order to improve both the design and experience for future users. Additionally, we ask that you keep in mind this is one of the first steps we must take when designing our application, and that we are only concerned with user interaction at this stage in development. 

Coffee Spies Overview 
Coffee Spies is a social media platform developed by three students in the Digital Design & Development (D3) program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). It’s main function is to allow for coffee enthusiasts to post and explore all content related to.. well, Coffee! Anything from “My Favourite Starbucks Drink”,  “Go-To Coffee Spot”, or “Homemade Coffee Recipe” is allowed within the application. Users can browse and interact with these posts with the ability to leave a like or a comment.   

First, we’d like for you to download this document as a .DOC or .DOCX (or save a copy within your own google drive) and to complete the tasks that follow within the next page. Once you’ve completed your document, please send it back to the facilitator that sent it to you. 

Please access our high fidelity Figma prototype using the following link: 
https://www.figma.com/file/ss5AMqklFdTh85cYU5RMgN/Final_MDIA_3109?node-id=0%3A1 

Once you’ve opened the link, press the play (Present) button located at the top right hand corner of the page, next to the “Share” option. It will allow you to view our prototype as if it were a real application. 

Further down on this document, you will be given 4 different tasks. Using the Figma, complete each task on the list. Keep in mind as you work to complete each task, that the evaluation is of the Coffee Spies application, not of you - the participant. 

Each task can be worked on at your own pace, if any task takes longer than 5 minutes, or you feel you are unable to complete a task due to functionality,  please note down the issues and feel free to move on.
